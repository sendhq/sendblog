                <h2>Information we collect and how we collect it</h2>
                <p>
                  We collect information directly from you when you provide it
                  to us and automatically when you use the Site.
                </p>
                <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
                <p>
                  We collect information from you when you register on our site,
                  place an order, subscribe to a newsletter or enter information
                  on our site.
                </p>
                <h2>Information you provide to us</h2>
                <p>
                  You do not have to give us personal information to visit our
                  Site. If, however, you access or use the Site, you may be
                  required to specifically and knowingly provide certain
                  information that will allow us to facilitate such access or
                  use. For example, parts of our Site allow you to purchase
                  products and services. If you wish to purchase such products
                  or services, we will request and collect from you the
                  information needed to fulfil your order or request, just as
                  though your order or request had been made on paper.
                  Information that we request may include, without limitation,
                  personal information such as your name, email address, and
                  other unique identifiers. You acknowledge that your access and
                  use of certain portions of the Site is conditioned on your
                  provision of certain information, including personal
                  information. You may decline to share information with us, in
                  which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the
                  features and functionality of the Site.

                <h2>Information we collect automatically</h2>

                  pages or download information), we will nevertheless
                  automatically gather and store certain information about your
                  visit. Such information that we automatically collect, and
                  store may include but is not limited to the following

                  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the

                  such as your bank account or charge card you should send it by
                  mail unless our Site indicates the transmission is secured. We
                  are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings

                  For Site security purposes and to ensure that the Site and

                  SEND employs software programs to monitor network traffic to
                  identify unauthorised attempts to upload or change
                  information, or otherwise cause damage.
