                    The Broker works with the information provided by the
                    Customer to arrange their shipment. The Broker provides no
                    guarantee that the Customer’s goods would be shipped even
                    after getting a quote.

                  The Service includes a platform whereby the Customer can
                  request pricing for a specific shipment (each an “Order”). The
                  Customer is responsible for providing, and shall provide, all
                  information requested by the Service (“Order Information”) and
                  warrants and represents that all such Order Information is
                  accurate and complete. The Broker will provide a price quote
                  (“Quote”) to the Customer via the Service based on the Order
                  Information input into the Service.

                    By providing a quote, the Broker is not guaranteeing that it

                    will use commercially reasonable efforts to do so.

                  The service will give the Customer the option of accepting the
                  quote. By accepting the quote, via the functionality provided
                  by the service, the Customer is authorizing the Broker to
                  arrange for transportation in accordance with the order
                  information and agrees to pay the price stated in the quote.

                  as an independent entity, and not as a carrier, in selling,
                  negotiating, providing, and arranging for transportation for
                  compensation, and that the actual transportation of shipments
                  tendered to the Broker shall be performed by third-party
                  shippers (“Shipping company”). The Broker and the Customer
                  represent and warrant that their relationship is that of
                  independent contractors and that the respective employees are
                  under their respective exclusive management and control.
                  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the
                  Broker to provide Services upon request of the Customer and
                  the Broker reserves the right to accept or decline, in its
                  sole discretion, any request for Services.

                  The Customer acknowledges that shipping companies may limit
                  their liability for cargo loss, damage, or delay. Upon request
                  from the Customer, the Broker will use reasonable commercial
                  efforts to determine and communicate the shipping company’s
                  limitation on cargo loss and damage liability to the Customer.
                  If the Customer wishes for the Broker to arrange for the
                  shipping company to assume liability in excess of the
                  otherwise applicable limitation, the Customer must make such
                  request to the Broker by contacting your designated sales
                  representative at the Broker to request an increased limit to
                  liability at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to scheduled
                  pick-up of the shipment.

                <p>
                  Upon receipt of such request, the Broker will use reasonable
                  efforts to source a shipping company able to perform the
                  services at the requested liability levels and if the Broker
                  is able to do so, will issue a revised Quote to the Customer
                  setting forth additional charges applicable to the Customer’s
                  request for additional recovery and the Customer agrees to pay
                  such additional amounts. If the Broker does not issue a Quote
                  setting forth additional charges related to the request for
                  the shipping company to assume additional liability, then the
                  Customer acknowledges and agrees that the shipping company’s
                  default limitation of liability will apply.

                  It will be the Customer’s responsibility to insure product
                  in-transit. The Broker may facilitate claims filing and
                  processing with the shipping company if the Customer submits
                  to the Broker, within sixty (60) days of the date of delivery,
                  a written claim, fully supported by all relevant
                  documentation, including but not limited to the signed
                  delivery receipt, listing the nature and cause of the claim
                  for cargo damage. The Broker may, in its sole discretion and
                  without liability to the Customer, discontinue pursuit of
                  claims with the shipping company if such claim is not resolved
                  within sixty (60) days of receipt by the Broker or if the
                  Customer, in the Broker’s sole discretion, fails to cooperate
                  with the Broker in filing of claims with the shipping company.
                  The Broker in no event shall be responsible for the outcome of
                  a claim with the shipping company or for the failure of a
                  Servicing Motor Carrier to perform any of its obligations

                  alleging the Broker’s liability for cargo loss and damage
                  within sixty (60) days of the date of delivery of the cargo in
                  question (or, if none, within sixty (60) days of the date
                  cargo should have been delivered). Failure to do so will
                  result in an absolute bar to any such claim and will relieve
                  Broker of any and all liability with respect thereto. In no
                  event will Broker have any liability arising from or related
                  to the shipping company’s refusal to accept full value
                  liability or the Servicing Motor Carrier otherwise limiting or
                  disclaiming its liability for cargo loss and damage.

                  The Broker shall be under no obligation to arrange, and the
                  shipping company shall be under no obligation to provide
                  service in accordance with any set pick-up or delivery
                  schedule; the Broker’s sole obligation is to ensure shipping
                  companies provide services with reasonable dispatch.

                  Any lawsuit arising from such claims must be commenced within
                  eighteen (18) months of denial of all or any part of such
                  claim. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the sole
                  liability of the Broker with respect to loss, damage or delay
                  to cargo shall be as set forth in this provision and Customer
                  warrants and represents that if it is not the owner of such
                  cargo, the Customer holds authority from such owner to bind
                  the owner to the provisions of this Agreement.
